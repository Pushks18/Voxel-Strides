# GitHub Setup Guide

Follow these steps to push your organized Voxel Strides project to GitHub:

## Initialize Git Repository

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with organized project structure"
```

## Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "Voxel-Strides")
4. Add an optional description
5. Choose public or private visibility
6. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (since we've already created these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Connect and Push to GitHub

Follow the instructions provided by GitHub after creating the repository. It will look something like:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Voxel-Strides.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Fixing Xcode Project Structure

Before pushing to GitHub, you may need to update the Xcode project to reflect the new folder structure:

1. Open the project in Xcode
2. If prompted about missing files, select "Find in Folder..." and locate each file in its new location
3. Alternatively, you might need to:
   - Remove references to missing files
   - Re-add them from their new locations
4. Save the project
5. Run the app to ensure everything works

## Structure Overview

The project is now organized into a logical structure:

- `App/` - Core application files
- `Models/` - Data models
- `Views/` - UI components
- `Features/` - Feature-specific modules
- `Managers/` - Service managers
- `Utils/` - Utilities and helpers

This organization makes the codebase more maintainable, easier to navigate, and follows standard iOS development practices.
